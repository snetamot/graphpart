In the code we find the optimal partion for a connected graph using spectral eigendecomposition methods on the weight matrix as well as the graph and normalized graph laplacian.

I was also trying to figure out how to do the local linear embeddings for the data (converting it from high dimensions to a lower dimension but still maintaing properties of the higher dimensional data)
